                    <p>similar to a slant route, a drag route is when a receiver takes a few steps downfield and then breaks towards the middle. It has a more "flat" trajectory from sideline to sideline than the angled route taken on a slant.</p>

                    <p>a basic, short route where a receiver, often a running back, tight end, or slot receiver, runs a few steps forward before quickly breaking outside towards the sideline.

                    <p>a comeback route is a route where a receiver sprints downfield before turning back towards the sideline. It is typically only run by an outside receiver because in conjucnction with a back-shoudler throw it becomes very difficult for the defender to reach. </p>

                    <p> An out route is similar to a flat route but run at much greater depth. The receiver runs 10-15 yards downfield and then breaks towards the sideline. Typically receivers catch this ball very clsoe to the sideline.</p>

                    <p> Often considered the most important position on the team, a quarterback (QB) stands behind the center and receives the snap to initiate the play. Once the play has begun a quarterback typically hands it off to another player, passes it, or attempts to run with it themselves. </p>
                    <p> The QB is typically the only player in direct communication with the coach while the offense is on the field. It is his responsibility to relay instructions to the rest of the team. </p>
                    <p> The most important attributes for a QB are throwing ability and intelligence. </p>

                    <p>Wide receivers are typically around 6ft tall and 200 lbs. Their most important attributes are speed and catching ability.</p>
                    <p>Top wide receivers at the pro level sometimes have a reputation for dramatic behavior. This stems from their desire to be targeted more by the quarterback for passes. </p>
